# Javascript-Password-Generator

## Task At Hand

This week, we were tasked with modifying existing code for an password generator application. The starter code that we were given did not allow the application to function correctly, as the "Generate Password" button was unresponsive and no functions ran within the browser.

We needed to make this application work correctly by adding additional Javascript within the .js file that would allow the application to run in the browser, and generate a password for the user based off of their inputs. 

Based off of the acceptance criteria for this assignment I had to create an string for each different type of character, and create user prompts for each type of character as well. We were also tasked with ensuring these prompts had validation coded within them as well, to ensure the user chose a password within a specified length. 

Once I had coded the strings, the prompts with validation, and some conditional statements I had to make sure that the "Generate Password" button also functioned by adding a for loop that would actually input the result of all the user choices into the text box!
